MECH_GOD INITIALIZATION COMPLETE
I have successfully initialized the mech_god format and created a comprehensive TODO.md tasklist plan following the charlie_p.mecha specifications. The plan utilizes the balance system with weight calculations:
BALANCE ANALYSIS
Minimal Tasks (--): -14 lbs (simplification and standardization)
Feature Tasks (++): +29 lbs (enhancement and functionality)
Net Balance: +15 lbs (Feature-rich with controlled minimalism)
KEY COMPONENTS IMPLEMENTED
The tasklist includes:
Phase 1 Foundation (MIML): Unified borders, spacing, colors, typography, layout simplification
Phase 2 Core Enhancement (FEAT): Advanced progress, dynamic tables, visual feedback
Phase 3 Advanced Features (FEAT): Syntax highlighting, interactive enhancements, theme system
Phase 4 Polish & QOL (FEAT): Console features, quality-of-life improvements
MECH_GOD STATUS
✅ INITIALIZED - Following charlie_p.mecha format specifications
✅ BALANCE ACHIEVED - +15 lbs net positive balance
✅ READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION - Phase 1 Foundation Tasks prioritized
The TODO.md file now contains a complete visual consistency overhaul plan that balances minimalism with feature richness, exactly as specified in the charlie_p.mecha format requirements.
